## 🧪 Testing Instructions

To test whether the program works correctly:

1. Run the script.
2. Provide sample values such as:
   - Land area: `10`
   - Crop yield per acre: `5`
   - Selling price per quintal: `2000`
   - Plantation cost per acre: `3000`
3. Manually calculate:
   - Total yield = `10 × 5 = 50 quintals`
   - Total revenue = `50 × 2000 = 100000`
   - Total cost = `10 × 3000 = 30000`
   - Profit = `100000 - 30000 = 70000`
4. Confirm that the program outputs the same result.
