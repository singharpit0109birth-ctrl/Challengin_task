# Crop Profit Calculator - README

## **Problem Statement**
Farmers often struggle to quickly estimate the profit or loss they may incur from cultivating a particular crop. The profit depends on several factors, including land area, crop yield, selling price, and plantation cost. Calculating these manually can be time‑consuming and may lead to errors. This project provides a simple Python-based calculator that automates this computation and gives an accurate profit or loss estimate.

## **Scope of the Project**
This project focuses on building a basic command-line tool that:
- Accepts key agricultural parameters as user input.
- Computes total yield, cost, revenue, and profit/loss.
- Helps farmers or agricultural planners quickly assess financial outcomes.

The current version supports only single‑crop calculations for a single season.

## **Target Users**
- Farmers planning seasonal crop cultivation.
- Agriculture students learning about crop economics.
- Researchers analyzing cost–benefit of various crops.
- Small agricultural businesses and advisors.

## **High‑Level Features**
- User-friendly input prompts for all major variables.
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Total crop yield
  - Total cultivation cost
  - Total revenue
  - Net profit or loss
- Clear result output with numeric profit/loss value.
- Easily customizable for additional crop parameters or multi‑season planning.
